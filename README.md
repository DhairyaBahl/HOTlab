
# Computational Holography

This component of ILLIXR is responsible for calculating image holograms (per-pixel phase masks) using the Weighted Gerchbergâ€“Saxton(GSW) algorithm.

### generateHologram

Host side kernel launch 

### propagateToSpotPositions

CUDA kernel that propagates from the SLM phases to the spot positions using Fresnel summation.

### propagateToSpotSum

CUDA kernel that sums up the per thread block result from propagateToSpotPositions kernel.

### propagateToSLM

CUDA kernel that calculates the error function of depth spots and updates the SLM phases.

The original hologram implementation we are improving from.

# Installation & Usage

Under `C/source/`

    make all
    make jetson

Make all is compiling using SM75 architecture, while jetson is using SM70 architecture. To run this code on a older NVIDIA GPU,  please change the SM architecture accordingly.

To run our modified hologram code,

    ./hologram

To run the original hologram code.

    ./goldenHologram


# Computational Hologram

This component is responsible for calculating the hologram, the per pixel phase mask, using WeightedGerchbergâ€“Saxton(GSW) algorithm. Base on an existing GPU implementation of the algorithm, we extend the code to be capable of computing arbitrary size hologram and improve the parallelisation.

# Installation & Usage

Under `C/source/`

    make all
    make jetson

Make all is compiling using SM75 architecture, while jetson is using SM70 architecture. To run this code on a older NVIDIA GPU,  please change the SM architecture accordingly.

To run our modified hologram code,

    ./hologram

To run the original hologram code.

    ./goldenHologram
